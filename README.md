# CollegePrediction
This project is a college prediction website that utilizes Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to forecast potential college admissions based on students' Common Entrance Test (CET) marks. The application takes user-inputted CET scores and employs a trained ML model to predict the likelihood of acceptance into various colleges.
